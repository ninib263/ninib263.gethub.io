    <p><em>by William Shakespeare</em></p>


    <P>Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?<br>
        Thou art more <em>lovely</em> and more <strong>temperate</strong>:<br>
        Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
        And summer’s lease hath all too short a <sup>date</sup>></P>
    <P>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br>
        And often is his gold complexion <sub>dimm'ds</sub>;<br>
        And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br>
        By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed</P>
    <p>But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br>
        Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,<br>
        Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,<br>
        When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st.<br>
        So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,<br>
        So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</p>
